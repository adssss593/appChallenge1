# Basic App Challenge

A single page of an app with simple functions. 
This single page will be a mock apllication form, requiring the user inputs their name, email address, password (and re-type), gender, country (from a dropdown menu) and agree to the User agreement.
If all of this info is filled in correctly, a snackbar with a "registration complete" message will show.
There will also be an exemplar image shown at the top, with a button to "select image". This is purely for layout purposes and, will not have a function for now but should show a toast messsage.
